          <h1>Prologue</h1>
          <p>
            Discord was started to solve a big problem: how to communicate with
            friends around the world while playing games online. Since
            childhood, founders Jason Citron and Stan Vishnevskiy both shared a
            love of video games, cherishing the friendships and connections that
            formed while playing them. At the time, all the tools built for this
            job were slow, unreliable, and complex. Jason and Stan knew they
            could make a better service that encouraged talking, helped form
            memories, and recreated the feeling of togetherness all found
            through gaming

          <h1>Chapter One</h1>
          <p>
            So in 2015, Stan and Jason started to bring Discord to life. People
            from all over the world lover it. Discord made it easy to genuinely
            communicate with friends, going beyond casual talking. Friends were
            staying in touch with their various communities. Discord was making
            it easy to participate in conversation, hopping around text, voice
            and video to talk. The technology was complex but the goal was
            simple: make Discord an inviting and comfortable home to jump into
            with your communities and friends. Within a few years, Discord began
            to take off, and devoted people who loved our product sprung up
            around the world
